# RESTful SPC sample code
Here you can find different samples for handling both HF and UHF transponders on devices running UNIX OS using a Micro-Sensys RFID reader.
Sample codes located in this folder are implemented accessing our *iID速service* (using RESTful communicating) 

> For details on SPC communication check [Useful Links](#Useful-Links) 


## Requirements
* IDE (for example Visual Studio Code)
* Micro-Sensys RFID reader (either Bluetooth or module)
* Any HF or UHF transponder

## Implementation
This code shows how to use **iID速service** and its RESTful API to read/write transponders. 
For demo purposes, a python console sample code and a HTML website with JavaScript code is provided. There are different projects available that show all the different functions provided.

> Class information is available under API documentation. See [Useful Links](#Useful-Links)

## Steps 
First of all, make sure *iID速service* is running on your machine (or machine where the RFID reader is connected and accessible over the network)

### Python console
 1. Import this project into your IDE. 
 2. First make sure the communication port name for the RFID reader is selected. 
 3. Then use the console *menu* to select the function to call

### JavaScript (+HTML)
 1. First make sure the communication port name for the RFID reader is selected using *interface.html*
 2. Open any other HTML files and select the function to call
